> There are days that make the sacrifices seem worthwhile.
> 
> And then there are the days where everything feels like a sacrifice.
> 
> And then there are the sacrifices that you can't even figure out why you're making.
> 
> A wise man once said: ***"You can have anything in life if you will sacrifice
everything else for it."***
> 
> What he meant is **nothing comes without a price**.
> 
> So before you go into battle, you better decide how much you're willing to lose.
> 
> Too often going after what feels good means letting go of what you know is right.
> 
> And letting someone in means abandoning the walls you've spent a lifetime
building. Of course the toughest sacrifices are the ones we don't see coming.
> 
> When we don't have time to come up with a strategy to pick a side or to measure
the potential loss.
> 
> When that happens, when the battle chooses us, and not the other way around,
that's when the sacrifice can turn out to be more than we can bear.
